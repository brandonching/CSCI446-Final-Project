Original Idea:
The application will facilitate the management of graduation-related events, showcasing each
event's details such as time, description, and additional information. Additionally, users will have
the capability to add or remove invitees for specific events.


Unexpected Complexity:
We had some issues with connecting our index.js file to Bulma CSS. We also had some technical issues with one of us having the formatting on his device displaying differently than how ours. 
Most Interesting Part:
I liked the creativity that we had giving us the ability to make whatever we chose. The guidelines were so light that we just implemented what we thought would be nice.
More Time:
If we had more time we would have changed our styling and made it look more centered. Also we would have added boxes around events and invites to make the site look more filled. Another change we considered was clearing white space, we could do this by making boxes bigger or added more functionality such as opening links to RSVP for events.
